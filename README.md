Hello,
My name is James Cardinale but everyone calls me Jimmy. I am currently employed at MS Walker which is a liquor and wine distribution company. I have been a Teamster for just over 10 years now.

I am an absolute golf nut, I love everything about the game. My wife and I just had our first child who is also named Jimmy, he is 7 months old. Video games, the 4 major Boston sports teams and some fishing are also hobbies of mine.
